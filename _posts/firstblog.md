# Final Year Project - Weekly Updates

## Week 1: Introduction to the Project Module
The first week was all about getting familiar with the final year project (FYP) module. The faculty and supervisors were introduced, and I was assigned my supervisor, **Geethu Joy**. The main lecturers for this module are **Fehmida Hussain** and **Roshen Renji**.

Key discussions in the lecture:
- Understanding the importance of the final year project and how it can boost our portfolio for future career opportunities.
- Exploring various fields of interest, such as software development, embedded systems, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, to align project ideas with career aspirations.
- Brainstorming potential project ideas, analyzing feasibility, and discussing them with supervisors for approval.
- Learning about the project timeline, submission deadlines, and assessment criteria to plan accordingly.
- Preparing the **first-cut proposal**, which includes an initial problem statement, research objectives, and a brief methodology.

## Week 2: Ethical Considerations in Research
This week's focus was on ensuring that our projects are ethically sound. The lecture emphasized the importance of ethical research and the necessary steps to avoid issues that could affect individuals or organizations when collecting data, conducting research, or performing testing.

Key takeaways from Week 2:
- Understanding **ethical guidelines** and compliance requirements for academic research, including informed consent and data privacy regulations.
- Learning about **real-world ethical case studies** to recognize potential risks in research and project development.
- Completing the **ethics approval forms**, which outline how the project will handle data collection, privacy, and participant consent, for supervisor review and peer evaluation.
- Discussing with supervisors how to ensure our projects do not inadvertently cause harm or violate any ethical standards.
- Gaining insights into the importance of responsible research practices and how they contribute to professional credibility and project success.

Moving forward, I will be finalizing my project idea by analyzing feasibility, gathering initial resources, and ensuring all ethical documentation is properly completed before proceeding to the next stages. Next week, I will focus on refining the proposal and gathering literature to support my research. Stay tuned for more updates!
